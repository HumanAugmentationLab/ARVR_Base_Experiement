# ARVR_Base_Experiement
This is one of the simplest experimental setups for Unity with LSL.

## IMPORTANT
Don't edit this unless you're sure of what you're doing!
Unity and git generally don't play nice, so editing the scene files in this repo could be disasterous, download it and test it, copy the scripts into your own code, even edit the code and fix errors if you like, **BUT DON'T EDIT THE SCENES**.
